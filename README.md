# Week9PersonalBookLog

For week 9, the project I decided on was to create a personal book log that will allow a reader to log their books, details, and ratings into a database. This database will hold all of the entered book information and will be searchable by varying criteria including rating, genre, and author.

The planner table can be found in the docx Word file found in this repository.
